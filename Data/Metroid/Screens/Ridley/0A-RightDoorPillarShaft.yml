      # The reason we have two top exists here is because if we only had one we'd
      # be linking the bottom and right door through the top inside the room, but
      # that's not logically possible. The right door can only be accessed through
      # the top if there's actually a room above us, and if there is both top exists
      # will be linked to the entrance nodes above.

      # This needs to be better detailed in logic for shuffling, such as the tile gaps
      # for any given exit/entrance to properly line up screens.
